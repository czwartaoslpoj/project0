Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My starting page is index.html, it contains 6 hyperlinks, stylesheet in which I used id selector to edit font-family, font-size and color in hyperlinks buttons. Ir contains also mobile-responsive media query. The font-size is changing with decreasing screen size. 

In tardigrade.html I used sass nesting and sass inheritance options.

In manatee.html I created a button and a form with question: Do you like manatees?

In misha.html I created a table and used the css selector ">". In this file I used classes and nested lists as well. Unordered list as a child of ordered list. 

In wombat.html I again used media query and used "::" css selector. 

in monmon.html I used the bootstramp grid model, that is also adjusting to the size of a screen. 

In aurora.html I used sass to create  variables "color" and "secondcolor".
